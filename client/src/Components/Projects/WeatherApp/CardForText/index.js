        Weather App in a day!

            <p>
During a <a href="https://schoolofcode.co.uk/" style={{ color: "#ff6d80" }}>
School of Code</a> workshop, I had the exciting opportunity to build a weather application with two other cohorts Max and Katie. The challenge was to complete the project within a day, time management was key. We we asked to build the app using TypeScript, I later converted it back to JavaScript to showcase it in my portfolio.<br></br><br></br>

The Weather App provides up-to-date weather information for any location around the world. It offers a simple and intuitive user interface, allowing users to search for a specific location and instantly retrieve the weather data. The app fetches real-time weather information from a reliable API.<br></br>

The app's main features include:<br></br>

<h3>1. Search Functionality:</h3> Users can enter the name of any city or location to retrieve the current weather conditions for that area. The app dynamically updates the displayed information as soon as the search is executed. <br></br>

<h3>2. Weather Details:</h3> The Weather App provides detailed information about the temperature, weather description, perceived temperature (feels like), maximum and minimum temperatures, wind speed, and humidity. These details help users get a comprehensive understanding of the current weather conditions.<br></br>

<h3>3. Icon Representation:</h3> To enhance the user experience, the app visually represents the weather conditions using intuitive icons. Whether it's a sunny day, rainy weather, or cloudy skies, the corresponding icon provides a quick and easily recognisable representation.<br></br>

Building this Weather App within such a tight timeframe challenged my problem-solving skills and ability to prioritise tasks effectively. It required careful planning, efficient code organisation, and quick decision-making. Despite the time constraints, I was able to deliver a functional and visually appealing application that meets the core requirements of a weather forecasting tool..<br></br><br></br>

Feel free to explore the Weather App and witness the result of my dedication and skill in action.
